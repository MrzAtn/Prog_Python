First of all we hope that you are all  keeping well and adapting to this new way of life.

Below you will find the link to a site which offers different free TOEIC training exercises including a complete test.

We  strongly suggest that you do a few TOEIC exercises regularly, The more you familiarize yourself with the typical
styles of questions/vocabulary the easier the complete test will be.
When you finish a complete test could you please let us  know your score. 
This is just to give us  an idea of your progress and won't be included in any table of grades.
